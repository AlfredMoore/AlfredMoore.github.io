I have recently completed my research at the I4FSI lab. The PI is a friendly and ambitious professor, while the lab members have been kind and willing to teach me everything about the lab and the upcoming lab days.

Together, we learned and worked on making robots learn. My task was to develop an amphibious quadruped robot, which required nearly a month to become familiar with the hardware and embedded systems. Luckily, the subsequent months were dedicated to my specialized areas of machine learning and personal self-learning.

After implementing about 90% of the algorithm and control system, it's time for me to return to the UMich campus, attend courses, and handle various matters.

I'm pleased to have met all of you and am looking forward to seeing you again.
