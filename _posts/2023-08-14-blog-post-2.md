I just finished my research in I4FSI lab. The PI is a nice and ambitious professor. The lab members are also kind to me and willing to teach me all I should know about the lab and the following lab days.

We together learned, meanwhile made robot to learn. I was to do a amphibious quadruped project, while it took me nearly a month to get familiar with the hardware and the embedded system. Then following months in my areas of machine learning and my own self-learning.

After 90% implementation of algorithm and control system, it is time back to UMich campus and courses, and all sorts of things. 

Glad to meet you all and looking forward to see you again.
