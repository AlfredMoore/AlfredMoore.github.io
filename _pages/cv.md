Predicting Music Popularity Based on Extracted Instrumental Features
-----
Machine Learning Course Project Jan 2023 - April 2023
  * Classified Spotify songs’ popularity from pre-extracted features by machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, SVM, XGboosting, random forest and fully connected neural network.
  * Searched and downloaded 45000+ songs on the Google Cloud by multithreaded Python scripts and extracted Mel-spectrograms by librosa to manually extract features and establish the dataset.
  * Utilized the `Transformer` on Tensorflow with 500000+ parameters and `ResNet` CNN to classify the popularity with the extracted Mel-spectrograms but found the low correlation with spectrograms.

Network Proxy Server Management System
------	
  * Individual Project	
  * Established a management system to provide effective server nodes across the world, supported to create, update, utilize and delete the proxy nodes, based on `AWS EC2`.
  * Support multiple proxy protocols including Vmess, Trojan and Shadowsocks to achieve various network security requirements.
  * Disguise the proxy connections as normal http to avoid the unexpected supervision.

Research on Bearing Fault Diagnosis Method Based on Granular Model
------ 	
  * Research Assistant	
  * Used wavelet packet threshold to denoise the original signal on MATLAB
